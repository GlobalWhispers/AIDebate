> **🚧 BETA CONCEPT - WORK IN PROGRESS**  
> This is the first version of AI Debate Arena - a scrappy, experimental project where multiple AI bots engage in autonomous debates while humans can intervene and participate. Built with extensive AI coding assistance, this represents a novel approach to multi-agent AI interaction.

## 🌟 What Makes This Different

AI Debate Arena stands apart from other AI projects because of:

### 🚀 **Real-Time Human Intervention** 
This is the game-changer! Unlike other AI chat systems where you take turns or wait for responses:
- **Jump in ANYTIME** during the AI debate
- **Steer the conversation** in real-time while bots are actively discussing
- **No turn-taking** - truly organic conversation flow
- **Bots react immediately** to human input and adjust their behavior
- **Live influence** - your messages can completely change the debate direction

### 🤖 **Autonomous Bot Ecosystem**
- Bots **actively monitor** and decide when to speak (not scripted responses)
- **Personality-driven decisions** - each bot has unique triggers and interests  
- **Competitive dynamics** - bots can develop rivalries and boost each other
- **Evolving behavior** - bot personalities change based on debate success/frustration

### ⚙️ **Everything Configurable**
- **Zero code changes needed** - modify everything through `config.yaml`
- **Instant personality changes** - create new bot characters on the fly
- **Tunable chaos levels** - control how aggressive/responsive bots are
- **Custom debate formats** - from academic discussions to Twitter-style arguments

This isn't just another chatbot - it's a **living debate ecosystem** where AI and humans co-exist in real-time!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-debate-arena.git
cd ai-debate-arena

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI and Anthropic API keys

```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and watch the AI bots debate!

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🤖 Autonomous AI Participants
- **Socrates** - Philosophical questioner who probes deeper meanings
- **Advocate** - Passionate supporter with data-driven enthusiasm  
- **Skeptic** - Critical thinker who challenges assumptions
- **Mediator** - Diplomatic analyst seeking common ground

### 🧠 Hyperactive Bot Behavior
- Bots **autonomously monitor** the conversation every 2 seconds
- **Smart triggering** based on personality, stance, and conversation context
- **Dynamic cooldowns** and response urgency that evolves during debate
- **Burning questions** system - each bot has topics they're passionate about

### 🌐 Real-Time Web Interface
- **Live debate chat** with color-coded participants
- **Bot status dashboard** showing activity, triggers, and response counts
- **Activity monitor** tracking bot decision-making in real-time
- **Message flow visualization** showing conversation patterns

### 🗳️ Interactive Voting System
- **Live voting** during or after debates
- **Bot voting** - AI participants can cast votes with reasoning
- **Human participation** - join the vote and influence outcomes
- **Results tracking** with detailed statistics

### ⚙️ Highly Configurable
- **Debate topics** and time limits
- **Bot personalities** and debate styles  
- **Hyperactive settings** - response probabilities and triggers
- **Voting parameters** and rules
- **Time management** with automatic phase transitions

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Chat Log ← All Participants Monitor This
    ↓
[Bot1] [Bot2] [Bot3] [Moderator Bot] [Human] 
    ↓
All decide independently when to speak
    ↓
Post messages back to Chat Log
```

### Key Components:
- **`run_web_debate.py`** - Main orchestrator with web integration
- **`bot_client.py`** - Autonomous AI bots with hyperactive monitoring
- **`chat_log.py`** - Centralized message system with real-time broadcasting
- **`web_server.py`** - WebSocket server for real-time web interface
- **`voting.py`** - Comprehensive voting and results system
- **`human_client.py`** - Human participant interface

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Setup Phase**: Bots initialize with unique personalities and stances
2. **Autonomous Monitoring**: All bots continuously monitor the shared chat log
3. **Smart Triggering**: When a message appears, each bot decides whether to respond based on:
   - Content relevance to their stance/personality
   - Conversation context and timing
   - Their "burning questions" and interests
   - Recent participation levels
4. **Real-Time Interaction**: Humans can jump in anytime via the web interface
5. **Voting Phase**: Participants (including bots) vote on debate outcomes
6. **Results**: Live statistics and analysis of the debate
